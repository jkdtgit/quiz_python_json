      "Explanation": "Jupiter is a gas giant made primarily of hydrogen and helium. Unlike terrestrial planets that have solid surfaces, gas giants like Jupiter don't have a well-defined solid surface, allowing them to accumulate more mass in a gaseous form. This composition has allowed Jupiter to grow significantly larger than planets with solid surfaces."
